Most of these efforts, however, are based on a secular humanist worldview that seeks to compel people to behave ethically without transcendent reason or power. The Christian faith, by contrast, maintains that God is the originator, motivator, and sustainer of moral behaviour, and points to a creative notion of goodness that cannot be achieved by human will or effort. In a secularized, AI-centric world, is it wise to de-platform Christianity? In this talk, Gretchen contrasts secular ethics with biblical righteousness and challenges the assumption that humanistic efforts alone will result in safe, ethical, or “good” AI.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Meta-Educator and Author Dr. Gordon E. Carkner helps us rethink our current identity crisis through the lens of Incarnation. Despite our amazing technology, many people today are experiencing identity angst and confusion. Some are in real crisis, going through 'disintegration' or 'alienation'. We have a strong sense that all is not well in late modern, individualistic, self-construction. Dr. Carkner suggests an alternative route to a more robust identity via the Christian narrative of the Incarnation of Jesus the Christ. This quest for identity involves our response to a call into dialogue from our Creator. It results in a more communal self-concept, where the particularity of each person is valued and protected. Join him in this exciting adventure of unpacking the plausibility of this fresh approach.

In light of the power of woke media, inconvenient facts get steamrolled. Western institutions, particularly the Christian church, are targeted. Even in halls of higher learning, facts are trounced by emotivism. Those who disagree are then marginalized as “denialists.” Trial is by social media and public ostracization is swift.
