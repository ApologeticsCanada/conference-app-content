          "description": "<p>The most significant question our students are asking is the question of identity, 'Who am I?' Culture tells them to first 'look in,' then around, and maybe finally up, in order to affirm whatever identity their emotions have chosen for themselves. This process leaves our students fragile, insecure, self protective and ultimately without freedom. The Gospel flips the cultural script on its head. The Gospel calls us to look up, then around, and finally in, to figure out what needs to be re-ordered to align with the identity God has given to us—the identity we have been created for. This is freedom. How do we build our youth ministry so that it helps students discover who they actually are, and embrace the resilient, loving, and freedom-giving identity they have been made for.</p>"

This led to a partnership with Andy Steiger and the creation of The Human Project for Kids book series.</p><p>Through workshops with both educators and parents, Rachel hopes to help equip adults to help the children in their care to engage in deep conversations about faith, develop habits of careful thinking, and to build a solid worldview that will stand firm through the changing tides of culture. </p>",

          "description": "<p>The Dishonesty Objection to Christianity from Science suggests that Christian beliefs are intellectually dishonest compared to scientific thinking. Atheists like Richard Dawkins argue that Christianity tends to ignore new evidence and holds onto pre-established beliefs. Critics argue that Christianity, unlike the open-mindedness of science, is resistant to change, doesn't reflect on itself, uses unfalsifiable claims, and claims certainty without sufficient evidence. This talk responds to such objections by pointing out the assumptions behind the dishonesty objection and drawing parallels and distinctions between how science and Christianity approach knowledge. Ultimately, this talk seeks to defend the Christian faith by highlighting the nuanced ways in which it engages with evidence, self-reflection, and transformative theological knowledge.</p>"
