Regardless of whether the Bible is true, some people refuse to accept its teachings because of what they perceive to be the barbarism contained therein. Didn't Lot's daughters get their father drunk in order to have incestuous sex? Didn't God command raped women to marry their rapist? Wasn't Israel commanded to kill women and children to make room for them as a nation?</p>"

          "description": "<p>On one level, the Bible is easy to understand. Christians all over the world with no training in biblical interpretation grow in their faith by simply reading the Bible. On another level, the Bible is very difficult to understand. Readers, both Christian and non-Christian, traditionalist and progressive, often misinterpret, misapply, or simply miss the point of many passages in the Bible. We will look at seven of the most common barriers that prevent us from interpreting the Bible wellâ€“and learn how to become better interprets along the way.</p>"

Knowing how old it is, what confidence do we have that it's been preserved correctly? Didn't the Church choose what books to put in the Bible and what books to leave out, at the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), all for political and theological purposes? Even if we can establish that it's been preserved, what good reason do we have to believe that the authors of the books of the Bible were telling the truth?</p>"
